# WordPress Featured Post IDs for Term Archives

This code lets you select posts on the edit term admin page and saves them as term_meta. The post IDs are sortable and saved as a comma separated string like `1,2,3` in the term meta field. You can use this to display a set of featured posts on term archives like categories or tags on the front end.
